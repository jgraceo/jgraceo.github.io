    <h1>Lilith's Shrine</h1>
    <p>Lilith’s Shrine is a creative exercise that asks users to participate in the production of a new story about the mythical figure—Lilith. You will be asked to reflect on what you know about Lilith and the stories she is involved in. What does she look like? What might she remind you of? Who is she to you, if any one at all? You get out of Lilith’s Shrine what you put into it; the more thoughtful your contemplation, the richer your experience.</p>
    <p>Lilith’s Shrine was made as a part of my Honors Interdisciplinary Thesis. This work builds upon <a href="pgarden.html">Persephone’s Garden</a> and <a href="brigid.html">Brigid’s Labyrinth</a>—two digital projects that combine the study of folklore, digital humanities, and gender. Each exhibit aims to immerse users into a unique learning experience and asks them to interact with ancient tales in distinctive ways. A meta-analysis of all three projects can be found <emph>here</emph>.</p>
    <p>Before stepping into Lilith’s Shrine, you may want to learn more about the person whose story you are trying to retell. Below is a very brief description of Lilith and her history.</p>
    <h2>Meet Lilith</h2>
    <p>Wild red hair, shadows and snakes, a seductive laugh: these images may flash through your mind when you hear the name Lilith. Lilith is a female figure from Jewish midrash—a type of biblical interpretation—most known for her role as Adam’s first wife. While never mentioned by name in the tale of Genesis, Lilith’s time in the Garden of Eden is told in the <i><a href="https://www.bensira.org/introduction.html">Alphabet of Ben Sira</a></i>. The story goes like this…</p>
    <h2>Lilith in the Garden</h2>
    <p>Lilith and Adam were both made from the earth by God. They were free to roam Eden as they pleased. The two lived peacefully in the garden until one day, when Adam and Lilith attempted to have sex, Adam demanded that he take the dominant position. Lilith saw herself as Adam’s equal and argued that she had just as much right to be on top as he did. Adam refused, causing Lilith to yell God’s name and run from Eden. Adam was saddened by this and asked God to bring his wife back. God then sent the angels Senoy, Sansenoy and Semangelof to collect her. They chased her to the Red Sea, pleading with her to go with them. Knowing she would not be treated as Adam’s equal, Lilith declined. It is here that the angels struck a deal with Lilith. If she did not return to the garden, one hundred of her children would die each day. Lilith agreed to this condition and declared that she would not harm any child who wore an amulet bearing any of the angel’s names.</p>
    <h2>Baby Killer</h2>
    <p>This is not the first time Lilith has been linked to child death. Lilitu and Lilu (words connected to Lilith) are a subclass of malicious gods and demons from ancient Mesopotamia known for harming pregnant women. These beings were said to be the cause of crib death, and stories were told about the demons kidnapping babies straight from the arms of wet nurses. During this time, it was not uncommon to make an incantation bowl with the name Lilith/Lilitu/Lilu written upon its surface. It was believed that the incantation bowls would keep the child killing spirits away from one’s home.</p>
    <h2>Seductress Supreme</h2>
    <p>Baby killer is not the only name given to Lilith. Later stories paint her as a seductress, haunting men’s dreams and causing them to get aroused in their sleep. Texts such as the <i>Talmud</i> and the <i>Book of Zohar</i> describe a Lilith who stalks young men and is summoned by sexual acts. It is even said that she steals seamen to create more demon children. It is interesting to note that the winged bird-like demon Lilith is described as during the Mesopotamian era seems to have shifted into an ugly but somehow also beautiful seducer of men.</p>
    <h2>Feminist Symbol</h2>
    <p>It wasn’t until the seventies that Lilith got a rebrand. Second-wave feminism was a period when scholars and activists really started to reexamine folkloric stories and characters through a new lens. Lilith was one such figure that was reevaluated through a feminist viewpoint. Her refusal to submit to Adam struck a chord among women of the era. Her role as a murderous demon was either ignored or embraced by her admirers. Her story was not only revisited, but retold—one notable work being “The Coming of Eden” by Judith Plaskow. Retellings of Lilith’s story became increasingly popular, specifically among Jewish women who felt deeply connected to the figure; it is likely because of this that the Jewish-American feminist periodical—<i>Lilith Magazine</i>—was created. Decades later, Lilith maintained the role of feminist icon. Her name was used for Lilith Fair—a concert emphasizing female musicians. Buffy Childerhose, author of <i>From Lilith to Lilith Fair</i>, remarks on the naming of the festival stating:</p>
    <p>“Like any myth or religion, we take those parts that can guide us in our lives and discard those elements that displease us. The story of Lilith is no different. While she goes on to be vilified and called a demon, I choose to ignore this part of the story as it is surely only the rantings of terrified men who were trying to keep other women from getting any silly ideas. What is important is that Lilith made a difficult and courageous decision and, in doing so, fell out of favor with the men in her life. So it can be said that Lilith was perhaps the world’s first feminist.” (xiii, xiv)</p>
    <h2>Lilith Today</h2>
    <p>Despite our distance from the second wave of feminism, Lilith still maintains relevance. There are certainly less stories being made that aim to retell Lilith’s time in Eden, but her name and the echo of what she stands for can still be found in media today. <i>Lucifer</i> (2016–2021), <i>The Fifth Element</i> (1997), and <i>Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</i> (2018–2022) are all works that engage with the figure to varying degrees; each story either draws upon the themes of creation connected to Lilith or attempts to rewrite her into a new setting. Lilith is also a name typically given to vampires and demons in movies, television, and video games. It is not uncommon to stumble upon a femme fatale that is in some way associated with the character. It can also be argued that her presence is felt in revenge movies where female leads target men who have harmed them, such as <i>Jennifer’s Body</i> (2009) and <i>Promising Young Women</i> (2020).</p>
