    <h2>Matt's Lilith</h2>
    <h3>November, 2023</h3>
    <p>To Matt, Lilith and her tale are misunderstood. "I think she's a story invented by men to normalize male dominance and villainize female power/autonomy/dominance."</p>
    <p>"I'd heard of her [Lilith] primarily in <i>The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</i> series. Her representation in that show aligns with most of what I've read so far, and her character even follows the progression of her cultural significance. She starts out as an evil, selfish servant to Satan and gradually becomes more of an ally to other women and a symbol of liberation/feminine power as the series progresses."</p>
    <p>Matt sees Lilith as a seductress. She wears a black dress, has red eyes and long silky hair. Maleficent, Jennifer Check from <i>Jennifer's Body</i>, and Cassandra from <i>Promising Young Woman</i> are a few characters that remind him of Lilith.</p>
    <p>"I appreciate the reclaiming of a figure invented/classically manipulated to normalize and moralize male dominance as a symbol of feminine power. She ultimately holds her own in the original myth and refuses to submit. While it's meant to be a cautionary tale, it makes more sense in the modern day as an exemplary feminist figure. At least the parts before she becomes a killer and tormentor, but even so she's just a story and I don't see an issue with hyperbolically adopting her as a woman-scorned cautionary tale for men rather than a woman-damned cautionary tale for women."</p>
    <p><u>Matt's Modern Retelling</u></p>
    <p>It'd probably be more from her POV and she'd do all the things we classically know about her but she'd have some kind of morally superior justification, and the baby-killing that seems so heinous would actually be something else, or have some previously unconsidered justification. Like Angelina Jolie's Maleficent. Her semen-stealer/baby-killer lore may be reconstrued as a revenge-movie-esque castration of men who force female submission (sexually or otherwise).</p>

    <h2>Emily's Lilith</h2>
    <h3>October, 2023</h3>
    <p>Emily had not heard of Lilith before engaging with this project. Her Lilith has red curly hair, is seductive, and constantly draped in a black traveling cloak. The images Emily associated with her are: manipulated, child killing, and woman scorned.</p>
    <p>"I don't think she is evil; I think her evil actions are thrust upon her in response to her reputation of independence and equality." Emily resonated with Childerhose's perception of the figure, acknowledging that "these evil attributes may have been given to her to keep women in their place–a woman who thinks herself an equal goes on to be a child murder. She is a victim and the archetype of a woman scorned."</p>
    <p>When writing about Lilith's connection to the feminist movement, Emily claimed this: "I think she has become linked because of her origins in standing up to all powerful men who history has chosen to admire. One thing about her that rings realistic is that standing up to these men will come at a cost. She is sexualized and demonized, which are typical routes men can use to discredit women. I do see how her child-killing behaviors might not align with the feminist movement, but very often with mythology we choose to ignore traits or stories we do not resonate with. It is interesting to note that a female figure who does not put her own life and rights aside in order to protect children becomes a child-killer, but in some ways this enhances her presence in feminism. It is a radical act for a woman to not prioritize children or have children, and she is an early figure that pays the price for these acts."</p>
    <p><u>Emily's Modern Retelling</u></p>
    <p>Lilith and Adam are betrothed, and Adam is the ruler of a mighty kingdom of Christianity. When Adam leaves Lilith for a girl his parents approve more of, Eve, Lilith goes on a journey of independence and sexual awakening. While she may become a morally grey character, readers find pride in her growth. A subplot would follow the actions of the kingdom of Christianity, making references to its own immoral actions throughout history.</p>
    <p><u>Emily’s Creative Piece</u></p>
    <p>My lovely little girl<br/>
    You were raised on a tipping rock<br/>
    But nobody saw your role in keeping it stable</p>
    <p>After they cast you off<br/>
    Found a softer figure to balance<br/>
    Of course you sought out their power</p>
    <p>If they demand your submission<br/>
    Why should it not summon you<br/>
    Why should you not resent the offspring of their abuse</p>
    <p>Spread your wings<br/>
    Push them off the rock<br/>
    The world will see your power</p>

    <h2>Nicole's Lilith</h2>
    <h3>October, 2023</h3>
    <p>Nicole knew Lilith before entering the shrine. She had heard her story but learned more about who she is and how she is perceived.</p>
    <p>Nicole's Lilith is strong willed. She envisions her as a beautiful goddess with dark red hair dressed in all black. In her modern retelling, "Lilith had a boyfriend named Adam who was too insecure to see her as an equal and was too scared of her determination, will power, and womanhood." Her retelling is titled "how men ruin everything."</p>
    <p><u>Nicole's Creative Piece about Lilith</u></p>
    <p>There once was a goddess named Lilith,<br/>
    She was renounced by the entire village.</p>
    <p>Because of an insecure man named Adam,<br/>
    whose ego was smaller than an atom.</p>
    <p>They almost had sex up against a wall,<br/>
    maybe not because his dick was too small.</p>
    <p>Adam refused to be submissive,<br/>
    Therefore he was very dismissive.</p>
    <p>He left Eden to go have a little cry,<br/>
    So Lilith decided to get high.</p>
    <p>She was determined to be the equal,<br/>
    So that women's empowerment would have a sequel.</p>
    <p>So next time you encounter a man like Adam,<br/>
    Remember Lilith, the one true madame.</p>

    <h2>Meghan's Lilith</h2>
    <h3>October, 2023</h3>
    <p>This project was Meghan's introduction to Lilith. She views the figure as misunderstood and "a woman in tune with her feminism."</p>
    <p>When Meghan imagines Lilith, she sees the color red and fire. "She stands tall and confident. She wears clothes that are dark or red in color, and almost like a jumpsuit or long dress. Her hair is dark and red toned, and long and flowing."</p>
    <p>Her Lilith is a rebel. "I think she is powerful, and people have mistaken her power and confidence for darkness and evil."</p>
    <p>"In her story, all of the myths and rumors about her came from her wishing to be equal to Adam. She was exercising her power as a female and refused to just submit to Adam, and society outcast her because of it. I think she is a pretty good figure, especially with the stories that surround her. A woman who is seen as equivalent to a demon all because she said no to a man."</p>
    <p><u>Meghan's Modern Retelling</u></p>
    <p>I can imagine it being somewhat similar to a lot of media there is in the present day, <i>Promising Young Woman</i> being one of the biggest examples I could think of. A story of a woman who says no to a man in some way, and is painted to be somehow evil or outcast because of it. In a modern retelling though, I feel it would end in a way that empowers the representation of Lilith, and calls on other women to feel empowered too.</p>

    <h2>Madison's Lilith</h2>
    <h3>October, 2023</h3>
    <p>Madison was aware of Lilith's existence but had never explored her story or history. "It was very interesting to hear that she was punished for her sexuality but unsurprising, as Eve was also villainized for power/sexuality."</p>
    <p>Madison sees Lilith as a powerful seductive villain but does not view her as evil. She recognizes that Lilith just wanted to be treated as Adam's equal. When picturing Lilith, Madison thinks of the colors black and red. Meaghan Markle and Monica Lewinsky are two people Madison thought of when learning about Lilith's mythology. "Women are villainized in the media and by reclaiming her [Lilith] you can reclaim other stories."</p>
    <br/>
    
    <h2>Neeraj's Lilith</h2>
    <h3>October, 2023</h3>
    <p>When asked if he had heard of Lilith before, Neeraj's response was this: "I hadn't. I was only familiar with the story of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden. However, I have seen some shows that have represented Lilith alongside Adam (<i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i>). From what I've seen in that show it aligns with what I've just read about Lilith and her struggle for equality."</p>
    <p>To Neeraj, Lilith is resolute and a martyr. He imagines Lilith with "long dark black hair and wearing a white silky dress." He is reminded of Jo from <i>Little Women</i>, Karen from <i>Daisy Jones and the Six</i>, and Lilith from <i>Neon Genesis Evangelion</i>.</p>
    <p>"I don't believe she is evil, I think she was treated unfairly by Adam, the Angels, and God. It's perfectly reasonable and justified to want to be treated as an equal to Adam, I would argue God and the Angels were evil for giving Lilith such a horrible condition to decide upon." She is "The Outlaw (for Liberation)."</p>
    <p>"I think she is a great figure to associate with feminism because of her strong conviction to do whatever it took to be treated as Adam's equal, even if it meant opposing God. She is a very motivating character to look up to when viewed from that perspective."</p>
    <p><u>Neeraj's Modern Retelling</u></p>
    <p><b>The Persecution of Lilith</b></p>
    <p>I think it would be along the lines of Lilith being put into an arranged marriage and she is forced to be in the stereotypical role of a housewife within this relationship. She has to squash all her dreams and ambitions so she doesn't threaten her husband (Adam). When she finally decides to get a divorce, the surrounding community and families all look down upon her for this decision. Everyone blames her and her family kicks her out. She is branded as evil for ruining this relationship, even though she was forced into these conditions.</p>
    <p>Neeraj decided to rewrite the story about Lilith leaving Eden from the informative section of this project.</p>
    <p><u>Neeraj's Rewrite of the Story of Lilith</u></p>
    <p>Lilith and Adam were both made from the earth by God. They were free to roam Eden as they pleased. The two lived peacefully in the garden until one day, when Adam and Lilith attempted to have sex, Adam demanded that he take the dominant position. Lilith was Adam's equal and logically argued that she had just as much right to be on top as he did. Threatened by this idea, Adam refused and Lilith had no choice but to flee Eden. Adam was saddened by this and asked God to bring his wife back. God then sent the angels Senoy, Sansenoy, and Semangelof to collect her. They chased her to the Red Sea, pleading with her to go with them. Knowing she would not be treated as Adam's equal, Lilith declined. The angels knew her will was resolute so it is here that they imposed a truly evil condition on Lilith. If she did not return to the garden, one hundred of her children would die each day. Faced with an extremely difficult dilemma, Lilith agreed to this condition and declared that she would not harm any child who wore an amulet bearing any of the angels' names.</p>

    <h2>Galia's Lilith</h2>
    <h3>October, 2023</h3>
    <p>This was not Galia's first encounter with Lilith. "I know about Lilith a bit as a sort of controversial biblical character. I also am a big fan of the magazine Lilith which is probably my main association with the word."</p>
    <p>"I don't know so much about early myths of Lilith, but what makes her avenue in Jewish thought particularly complicated in this regard is that many ~mainstream~ Jewish scholars, especially medieval scholars like Maimonides, don't really write about Lilith at all. Thus, I think she is in some ways (at least in the Jewish tradition, I don't know much about Lilith in Christianity or other faiths) often given more "credit" than you might expect for the way her character is portrayed because she is, at least in early instances, only really discussed by Jewish thinkers who are already open to alternative or atypical interpretations of genesis which lends her more credit than a typical "scorned woman" character."</p>
    <p>Galia's Lilith is powerful and subversive. "I picture a sort of Pre-Raphaelite redhead for some reason? Something like La Ghirlandata by Dante Gabriel Rossetti." She thinks of the characters Jennifer from <i>Jennifer's Body</i> and Victoria from <i>Twilight</i> when pondering Lilith.</p>
