<h1>welcome to my wacky, creaky, and maybe even gawky website!</h1>
   <img src="images/cherrytree.JPG" width="700px" align="left"><p>This is an online portfolio I created for a digital writing class that is slowly evolving into a personal website. I have taken liberties with grammar and ignored traditional understandings of professionalism. I want this space to be unrestricted by expectation and represent my personal and academic interests. I am still learning HTML, and there are bound to be errors and mistakes within these pages. This website contains a collection of some of my work and current exploration. Class assignments, published articles, and personal research are some of the things that can be found here.</p>
    <p>This site is constantly being updated and changed. Portions are actively under construction. You will have to be a little patient during your navigation. I have made sure to specify when a page is still being developed.</p>
    <p>Click on Karl (a loveable rock who lives in the right corner) to be directed to a random page on the site.</p>
